# Digital Steganography
We are exploring how to securely send and retrieve hidden information within images using digital steganography.

## Project Overview
In this project, we’re developing a program to hide encrypted data within images using digital steganography. The project involves two components:
- `Image Encryption Program`: Encrypts an image by embedding hidden data into it.
- `Image Decryption Program`: Extracts and decrypts the hidden data from the encrypted image.
Both components will be integrated into a web application, allowing users to upload images with embedded data, which the recipient can decrypt and retrieve. The application will be built in Java.
